STEPS TO ADD NEW GAME THEME


[1] Background & Square
  
    In 'assets/css/themes.css', design how an indivisual square and the background should look like.


[2] Font Color, Bomb Color & Type of Bomb

    i. In 'assets/js/description.js', go to the method setThemeProperties().
    ii. At the end of the 'if' block, put this code segment and edit the values inside.
    
      
      else if (document.body.classList.contains('theme-name')) {
        digitColors =  ['color-of-digit-1',
                        'color-of-digit-2',
                        'color-of-digit-3',
                        'color-of-digit-4',
                        'color-of-digit-5',
                        'color-of-digit-6',
                        'color-of-digit-7',
                        'color-of-digit-8'];

        bombType = 'Html tag to design a bomb.
                    Example: <i class="fas fa-snowflake></i>"';
        bombColor = 'Add a colorname, hex, rgb or hsl value';
      }


[3] If you add some image as background in the previous step, go to 'assets/images' and put the images there. Use relative path of that folder as image src path.


[4] Select Option in Game

    i. Go to 'game.html' file.
    ii. Move inside body > content > game > select.
    iii. Paste this and change value (The exact name which class was implemented in step1) & Change the name for user-interface.

            <option value="theme-themename">Theme Name</option>
            
 
[5] Flag Type

    You can change the flag type just like how the bomb was changed. Although it's not implemented yet. So code may has to change in many part of the js files.


We are good to go now! ENJOY! ☻☻☻☻
